            <h2>Questions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>The server responds to the client's requests, retrieves, and transmits files to the client.</li>
                <li>The client locates and requests web pages through a browser from a server. Then it renders the web page in the browser.</li>
                <li>An IP address is an identification every device connected to the Internet has, which lets it communicate with other devices.</li>
                <li>DNS stands for Domain Name Server which is a computer that maps websites symbolic names (URLs) to their IP addresses.</li>
                <li>The Internet is the worlds largest network of connected devices, while the WWW is an application used on the Internet and a system of interconnected hypertext documents.</li>
                <li>HTML is a markup language for documents on web pages, and is used to structurize information and to describe the web page for a browser to read.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Questions 2</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Inline CSS styling overrides style elements and external stylesheets because it is more local and therefore more specific.</li>
                <li>You can use #id to mark a specific paragraph you want to have a certain styling. Classes can be used when you want e.g. all textboxes on your page to have the same styling.</li>
                <li>RGBA stands for "Red, Green, Blue, Alpha", where alpha indicates opacity. RGBA can express essentially all colors, including their different opacities.</li>
                <li>We put CSS files in the head because then the styling loads first, making things appear on the page so that it's not blank until everything is loaded. It also prevents re-rendering of the page when the CSS has finally loaded.</li>
                <li>To match all the p elements in the HTML, you only need the name "p" for all the paragraphs to be selected.</li>
            </ol>
